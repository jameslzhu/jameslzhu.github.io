I'm learning to build things. Someday they may make the world better.

I'm a second-year EECS student at UC Berkeley, and a FIRST Robotics alumni.

I think about ways to make learning more compelling, to use game design outside of
games, to make the unimaginable visual, and to understand the impossible.
